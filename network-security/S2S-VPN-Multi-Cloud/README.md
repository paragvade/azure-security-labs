# Site to Site VPN
- A connection that links two networks together over the internet using an encrypted tunnel.
- Common use case is connecting resources from on-premises datacenter to Azure securely over the internet.
- - **ExpressRoute** - completely private connection. Does not traverse through public internet. Offers higher bandwidth and lower latency than VPN. Enterprises neeeding high-throughput, large scale data transfers between on-prem and Azure may prefer this over S2S VPN.
